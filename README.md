# InventoryApp
Created to practice using React Native and gain experience with Javascript.
Was created to be used by my organization while working concession booths at college football games.
Holds a list of items, along with their prices, with a count that can be incremented or decremented next to each item's name. 
Total price is displayed at the bottom and updates by item prices as item counters are incremented or decremented.
